# Neural Network Charity Analysis with Keras

## Overview - Purpose

Beks needs help creating a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup company. They have provided us with a CSV containing more than 34000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Our goal is to preprocess the data, then create a basic neural network model, compile, train, and evaluate it. Afterwards, we will attempt to optimize it by performing more preprocessing by dropping bad columns, performing more binning for rare occurences, handling skewed data, and changing model parameters.
